# Traffic Accident Prediction and Prevention Using ML and MLOps
## Setup
All the setup instructions are contained within the PDF dissertation documents.

## About
This paper explores how recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and the increased
abundance of open-source datasets can be leveraged for helping predict and possibly
prevent road traffic accidents within Smart Cities, specifically Greater London as a
use case. This also includes investigating how could such processes be automated and
made more predictable using Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
