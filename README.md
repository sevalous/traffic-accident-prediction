## 📊 Data Sources

Data is critical for the success of this project. We utilized various datasets to train and evaluate our models. Key sources include:

- Government traffic accident reports
- Open data portals from city traffic departments
- Historical traffic data from transportation agencies

These datasets provide insights into accident patterns, contributing factors, and time-based trends.

## 🧠 Model Development

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is essential for effective model training. We performed the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features that enhance model performance, such as time of day, weather conditions, and traffic density.
- **Normalization**: Scaled features to improve convergence during training.

### Model Training

We employed LSTM networks for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. The training process involved:

- **Splitting Data**: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes, and LSTM configurations to find the optimal setup.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.

### Results

The trained model demonstrated promising results in predicting traffic accidents. Key findings include:

- Improved accuracy in high-traffic scenarios.
- Insights into peak accident times and locations.

For detailed results and metrics, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
